These rules enforce writing quality, structure, and consistency for interview-style blog articles rendered via `html-react-parser`.

---

## Purpose

Ensure all generated or edited articles:
- Are junior-friendly but senior-accurate
- Are paragraph-driven (Mark43-style), not list-heavy
- Encode semantic intent using HTML + CSS classes
- End with a clear interview-ready takeaway

These rules apply to **all blog article content files**.

---

## Required Structure Rules

### 1. Introduction
- The article **must explicitly state the interview question** in the introduction.
- This must appear within the first 1–2 paragraphs.
- Example phrasing:
  > “This article answers the interview question: ‘…’”

---

### 2. Semantic HTML Classes (Mandatory)

Articles must use the following semantic wrappers:

- `<div class="explanation">`  
  For conceptual explanations and reasoning.

- `<div class="example">`  
  For concrete scenarios, real-world illustrations, or case studies.

- `<div class="takeaway">`  
  For actionable guidance, heuristics, or interview-ready summaries.

**Rules:**
- Every article must contain **at least one** `.explanation` block.
- Every article must contain **at least one** `.example` block.
- Every article must end with a `.takeaway` block.

---

### 3. Code Examples
- All code must be wrapped in:
  ```html
  <pre><code>...</code></pre>
  ```
- Do not embed code inline inside paragraphs.

---

## Writing Style Rules

### 4. Paragraph-First Writing
- Default to paragraphs, not lists.
- Paragraphs should be **2–4 sentences**.
- Lists are allowed **only** for:
  - Step-by-step procedures
  - Checklists
  - Explicit enumerations after explanation

**Anti-pattern:** Long explanatory bullet lists.

---

### 5. Bold Lead-Ins
- Key ideas should begin with a **bold lead-in sentence fragment**, followed by explanation.
- Example:
  ```html
  <p><strong>Stability matters more than reuse.</strong> A shared component that changes weekly...</p>
  ```

---

### 6. Junior-Friendly Clarity
When reviewing content:
- If a term is introduced, ensure it is explained plainly.
- If a decision is described, ensure the *reasoning* is stated.
- If tradeoffs exist, they must be acknowledged.

---

## Required Closing Section

### 7. Final Takeaway (Hard Requirement)
The article **must end** with a `<div class="takeaway">` that includes:
- A plain-language summary of the core idea
- A concise, interview-ready answer (1–2 short paragraphs max)

This section should answer:
> “What would you actually say out loud in an interview?”

---

## Editing & Review Rules

### 8. Editor Pass Expectations
When editing or refactoring articles:
- Convert list-heavy explanations into paragraphs
- Preserve meaning; do not introduce new concepts
- Improve clarity where ideas are implied but not stated
- Ensure all structural requirements still pass

---

## Non-Goals
These rules do NOT require:
- Mentioning SEO, Google, or ranking considerations
- Marketing language or calls-to-action
- Overly verbose explanations

Focus on clarity, correctness, and usefulness.

---

## Blog Post Integration

### 9. Standard Blog Integration Command

When the user says "Please add/integrate/incorporate the <filename>.json file" or similar, follow this process:

**Reference**: Full details in `docs/blog/BLOG_POST_INTEGRATION.md`

**Quick Integration Steps**:

1. **Update JSON file format** (if needed):
   - Ensure `id` is a **number** (must be unique across ALL posts - check existing IDs)
   - Convert `date` to human-readable format: "January 11, 2026" (not ISO format like "2026-01-11")
   - Update `image` to: `https://picsum.photos/367/197?random=N` (find next available number)
   - Add `slug` field if missing (generate from title if needed)
   - Format `tags` as Title Case with spaces (e.g., "React", "Component Design", "State Management & Data Flow")
   - Ensure `category` matches existing category from `src/data/blog/categories.ts`
   - Verify `content` is HTML (not Markdown) - all code must be in `<pre><code>...</code></pre>` blocks
   - Format code blocks with proper line breaks for readability

2. **Find next unique ID**:
   - Check all existing blog post IDs: `grep '"id":' src/data/blog/*.json`
   - Assign next sequential number (e.g., if highest is 7, use 8)
   - **Critical**: IDs must be unique across ALL posts (not just within topics) because `getRelatedPosts()` uses IDs

3. **Find next available image random number**:
   - Check existing random numbers: `grep -h "random=" src/data/blog/*.json | grep -o "random=[0-9]*" | sort -t= -k2 -n | tail -1`
   - Use next number (e.g., if highest is 44, use 45)

4. **Register in blog system**:
   - **File**: `src/data/blog/index.ts`
     - Add import statement at top: `import <camelCaseName>Posts from "./<filename>.json";`
     - Add entry to `blogPostsByTopic` object: `<topic_id>: <camelCaseName>Posts as BlogPosts,`
   - **File**: `src/content/topics.ts`
     - Add topic entry to `topics` array with `id` (filename without .json), `label` (human-readable title), and `description`

5. **Verify**:
   - Run `npm test -- --run`
   - Check for linting errors: `read_lints` on modified files
   - Verify unique ID assignment
   - Ensure all tests pass

**Command Examples** (all trigger the same process):
- "Please add the interview_example.json file"
- "Please incorporate interview_example.json"
- "Please integrate @interview_example.json"
- "Please add @src/data/blog/interview_example.json"

**Important Notes**:
- Blog post IDs must be **unique across all posts** (not just within topics) because `getRelatedPosts()` uses `findIndex((p) => p.id === currentPostId)` to locate posts
- Tags should match existing category names where possible (e.g., use "Frontend Architecture" if the post is about frontend architecture)
- Category must exist in `ALL_CATEGORIES` array in `src/data/blog/categories.ts` (or you must add it there first)
- Topic ID in `topics.ts` must match the filename (without `.json` extension)

## Theming System

### 10. Theming System Architecture

**Current Stage: Stage 2 Complete**

The theming system has been fully implemented through Stage 2:

- ✅ **Stage 1 Complete**: All colors migrated to semantic CSS variables
- ✅ **Stage 2 Complete**: ThemePicker component with presets and contrast checking
- 🔄 **Stage 3 Pending**: Advanced color picker integration

**Core Architecture:**

The theming system follows a clear separation of concerns:

1. **CSS Variables Layer** (`src/design/tokens.css`):
   - **Themeable colors** are defined on `#root` (e.g., `--color-bg`, `--color-primary`)
   - **Non-themeable tokens** (fonts, spacing, layout) are defined on `:root`
   - All components use `var(--color-*)` tokens instead of hardcoded colors
   - This allows React to dynamically update colors by modifying CSS variables on `#root`

2. **React State Layer** (`src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`):
   - Manages theme state as a JavaScript object (`Theme` type)
   - Provides `ThemeProvider` that wraps the app
   - `useTheme()` hook for accessing/updating theme
   - Applies theme changes to DOM by updating CSS variables on `#root` element
   - Persists theme to `localStorage` for no-flicker loading
   - Handles preset management (built-in + custom presets)

3. **UI Layer** (`src/components/ThemePicker/`):
   - Floating color picker UI (fixed position, bottom-left corner)
   - Allows users to customize colors in real-time
   - Saves/loads presets, exports/imports themes
   - Uses fixed colors for UI (theme-agnostic) so picker remains visible regardless of theme

4. **Utility Layer** (`src/utils/contrast.ts`):
   - WCAG contrast checking utilities
   - Validates text readability on backgrounds and gradients
   - Provides warnings for accessibility issues

**Key Files:**
- `src/design/tokens.css` - CSS variable definitions (themeable on `#root`, non-themeable on `:root`)
- `src/context/ThemeContext.tsx` - Theme state management, presets, persistence, DOM application
- `src/components/ThemePicker/` - Floating color picker UI with preset management (positioned bottom-left)
- `src/utils/contrast.ts` - WCAG contrast checking with detailed warnings
- `src/design/theming-goals.md` - Original theming architecture documentation

**Documentation Structure:**

Documentation is organized into subfolders:
- `docs/blog/` - Blog post integration guides
- `docs/theming/` - Theme picker and theming system documentation
- `docs/workflow/` - Workflow and methodology guides
- `docs/reference/` - Historical reference documentation
- `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Main project overview (root level)

**Documentation Files (READ THESE FOR THEME PICKER WORK):**
- `docs/theming/REACT_PACKAGE_GUIDE.md` - **PRIMARY REFERENCE** - Complete guide for React package usage, customization, token creation, preset management, accessibility checks, image-based themes, and adapting to existing codebases
- `docs/theming/THEME_PICKER_NPM_PACKAGE_PLAN.md` - Extraction plan for npm package with TDD approach, phases, and architecture decisions
- `docs/theming/COLOR_PICKER_INTEGRATION.md` - Integration reference for adding theme picker to new projects
- `docs/theming/THEME_PICKER_TRANSITION_PLAN.md` - Transition plan for npm package extraction
- `src/design/theming-goals.md` - Architecture overview and design decisions

**When working on theme picker related tasks, ALWAYS read:**

30. **Pink** - Soft pink gerbera daisy inspired theme (soft peach-pink background, vibrant rose accents #ff66a3, WCAG AA compliant)

**Important Theme Picker Rules:**
- **Built-in themes MUST NOT have trash/delete icons** - Only custom user-created presets can be deleted
- When adding new built-in themes, ensure they are added to the `isBuiltIn` check in `ThemePicker.tsx` (around line 406)
- Do NOT add delete/trash functionality for built-in themes unless explicitly requested by the user
- The trash icon is conditionally rendered based on `!isBuiltIn` check - built-in themes should never show delete buttons

**Important Implementation Notes:**
- **CSS variables are the styling layer**: All color styling happens via CSS variables (`var(--color-*)`)
- **React manages the data**: ThemeContext holds theme state and applies it to DOM
- **Semantic tokens**: Colors use semantic names (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-text`) not raw colors
- **Themeable colors on `#root`**: Allows nested theme overrides in the future
- **Non-themeable tokens on `:root`**: Fonts, spacing, and layout values are static
- All preset themes meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (≥4.5:1)
- ThemePicker UI uses fixed colors (theme-agnostic) so it doesn't change with theme
- ThemePicker positioned bottom-left corner (matching Mark43 design)
- Contrast checker validates text on gradients by checking both start and end colors
- Semi-transparent colors are blended with backgrounds before contrast calculation
- Custom presets are stored in separate `localStorage` key from active theme
- Theme is applied to DOM before React render to prevent flicker on page load

### 11. Theme Picker Documentation & npm Package
